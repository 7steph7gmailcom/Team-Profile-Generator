## Team Profile Generator
This assignment was to build a command line application that allowed the user to add employees to a roster. The user can fill out pertinent information concerning the employee with a list of questions they are prompted to fill out. Once the user is finished adding employees to the system, they can exit out of the application and the team of employees will generate into an HTML file in a nice card filing system.
